            <p class="text-xl mb-2">
                As a student I always wanted a clear idea of how much of the academic syllabus I had finished before the
                final exam, I used to manually check the chapters and topics I had completed. This was a time-consuming
                process and I always thought of creating a web application that would help me keep track of my progress.

                This project is the first one I made with Vue and fell in love with the framework and ecosystem around it.
                It is built using the Vue 3 framework and Tailwind CSS. The application is built using the Composition API
                and Vuex for state
                management. The project is also integrated with Firebase for authentication and database services. The
                project is hosted on Netlify and the source code is available on GitHub. Feel free to explore the project
                and provide feedback.
